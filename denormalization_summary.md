# Denormalization Summary

## Changes Made
The denormalization process involved combining related data from multiple normalized tables into fewer, more comprehensive tables to optimize query performance. Below are the key changes made:

### 1. Client_Details Table
- **Combined Tables**: `Clients`, `Membership`, and `Discounts`.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies querying client-specific data such as membership and discount details.

### 2. Class_Details Table
- **Combined Tables**: `Fitness_Classes` and relevant `Staff` (Instructor) details. Added booking information from `Class_Bookings`.
- **Purpose**: Reduces joins required for class schedules and bookings.

### 3. Personal_Training_Details Table
- **Combined Tables**: `Personal_Training_Sessions` with trainer and client details.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies querying training session schedules and trainer information.

### 4. Health_Assessment_Details Table
- **Combined Tables**: `Health_Assessments`, trainer details, and client details.
- **Purpose**: Reduces complexity in retrieving health assessment and associated personnel details.

### 5. Gym_Usage_Details Table
- **Combined Tables**: `Gym_Attendance` with `Facilities`.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates monitoring of client attendance and facility usage.

### 6. Billing_Details Table
- **Combined Tables**: `Billing`, `Clients`, and `Discounts`.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies financial reporting by embedding client and discount details.

### 7. Equipment_Rental_Details Table
- **Combined Tables**: `Equipment_Rentals`, `Facilities`, and `Clients`.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies queries for rental and facility information.

## Why This Is Denormalized
1. **Data Redundancy**:
   - Redundant data like client names and discount details eliminate the need for joins.
   
2. **Pre-Aggregation**:
   - Related data aggregated into fewer tables improves query efficiency.

3. **Optimized for Read Performance**:
   - Queries involving related data no longer require multiple joins.

4. **Simplified Querying**:
   - All necessary data for a query is available in a single table.

## Points That Can Be Normalized
While denormalization improves query performance, it introduces redundancy and risks inconsistencies. The following aspects can be normalized:

1. **Redundant Client Data**:
   - `Client_Name` can be normalized to reference the `Clients` table.

2. **Staff Information**:
   - `Instructor_Name` and `Trainer_Name` can be normalized to reference `Staff_ID`.

3. **Facility Data**:
   - `Facility_Name` and `Facility_Location` can be normalized to reference the `Facilities` table.

4. **Discount Details**:
   - `Discount_Type`, `Discount_Code`, and `Discount_Amount` can reference the `Discounts` table.

5. **Membership Information**:
   - `Plan_Type`, `Start_Date`, and `End_Date` can reference the `Membership` table.

6. **Class Bookings**:
   - Booking details can remain in the `Class_Bookings` table.

## Balanced Approach
A balance between normalization and denormalization can optimize performance:
- **Highly Queried Data**: Keep denormalized for performance.
- **Rarely Queried or Updated Data**: Normalize to reduce redundancy and ensure integrity.
