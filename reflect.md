## Challenges 

    Normalization vs. Performance: Striking the right balance between normalization and performance.

    Scalability: Designing a schema that can handle future growth without significant refactoring.

    Query Optimization: Anticipating and designing for efficient query execution, especially for complex queries and high-volume transactions.

    Compliance Requirements: Ensuring the design adheres to regulatory standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.

    Data Integrity: Ensuring constraints and rules are properly defined to maintain data consistency (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints).

## Fundamental learnings

    Learnt how to normalized an ERD while also maintaining the performance of the system.

    Developed critical problem solving skills by designing a future-proof schema.

    Analytical thinking skills were developed by finding feasible solutions to the challenges mentioned above.
